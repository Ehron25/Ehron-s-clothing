									<h2>Store info</h2>
									<p>It started in the early 90’s when Ehron's clothing was first set up in Makati as a made-to-measure dress shop. In 1992, Bayo sought
									to take matters into greater heights and soon after many years, our collections are being sought after by budding
									fashionistas from all over the country. Origin wise, the term “Clothing” is from an english word meaning “dress”. With every
									collection released by Ehron's Clothing, a touch of fine quality and exquisite taste is evident in every piece. The brand grew
									exponentially through the years and now, Ehron's clothing is known for delivering a classy and clean image with blouses and dresses
									or a casual and relaxed look with their shirts and stylish bottoms.</p>
